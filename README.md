Analysis in jupyter and powerpoint, made with python

Files in portuguese (pt-BR) and english (en-US)

Each paste contains:
* A python notebook
* A presentation in .pptx (powerpoint)
* A .pdf file converted

Note: In the .pptx and .pdf files, the graphic library used is plotly, since GitHub can't display plotly graphs, I used seaborn.

In kaggle, it's show in the plotly display: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mlippo/py-business-case-eda
